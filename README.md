## Architectural Principles

- Zero Client Framework Overhead: Built entirely with vanilla TypeScript compiled directly to modern ECMAScript modules,
  eliminating virtual DOM diffing, runtime framework weights, and hydration delays.
- Audited Performance Standards: Structured to enforce perfect 100/100 metrics across Performance, Accessibility, Best
  Practices, and SEO under Lighthouse CI.
- Modern CSS Cascade Architecture: Employs CSS Cascade Layers (@layer reset, base, components, utilities) to enforce
  deterministic specificity and modularity without CSS preprocessors.
- Hardened Client-Side Privacy: Implements zero third-party telemetry, tracking scripts, or analytics cookies. Contact
  links leverage memory-stored obfuscated byte arrays to prevent crawler harvesting.
- Edge Delivery: Distributed via Cloudflare Pages global CDN with Level 2 Content Security Policy headers, Brotli
  compression, and immutable caching for static assets.

- Runtime/Target: ECMAScript 2022 (ESNext)
- Code Quality: ESLint (typescript-eslint strict type checked), Prettier
- Continuous Integration: GitHub Actions with automated linting, typechecking, bundling, and Lighthouse CI assertions
